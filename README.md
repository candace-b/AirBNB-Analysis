# AirBNB-Analysis- IN PROGRESS

### 👉 Context:
As Austin, TX continues to boom, the surrounding areas are seeing growth too. Cities like Dripping Springs, Wimberley, and Georgetown were already popular wedding sites, and weekend getaways, but the draw to these areas seems to be increasing. This project seeks to evaluate if there are opportunities for Airbnb investors to expand their properties outside of the congested areas, and into fresher waters.

### 🏘️ Objective: 
To provide a tool to Airbnb Investors evaluating investment opportunities in the 6 counties surrounding Austin, Texas.

### 📄 Data source: 
This dataset originates from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/explore/), and evaluates location and growth of Airbnb listings in select cities, including Austin, Texas.
